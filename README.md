# mastermind_CLI
A CLI mastermind coded in python, for school. 
You play this way :
  Use only 4 letters to play, which HAVE to be in the list "['R','G','B','Y','W','M']" or the programm will crash. It basically means that you play as example "RGBY" -> 1red2green3blue4yellow
    You have 12 attempts before the game stops
    An indicator next to each line shows you things :
      -A green point means that a pawn is at the right place. The position of the point doesnt matter.
      -A blue point means that a pawn is in the combination.
   As example :
    the solution is RGBY.
    The RBGW could display  : Red point , blue point, green point, blue point
